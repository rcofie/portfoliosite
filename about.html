        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      <br>
  I took a Photography course in school which introduced me to the world of design and creative direction.
  This led me to take a gap year where I freelanced in the fashion industry.
  As a result, I started <a href="http://www.subculturedmag.com">SUBCULTURED â€“ a fashion, culture, art and music publication, written by students about students</a>, at university alongside my interdisciplinary Liberal Arts and Sciences degree where I studied various modules such as Marketing Communications, Internet & Society and Psychology.
  During this time, I also worked in the Creative agency of MATCHESFASHION.COM for my placement year which enhanced my knowledge of Design and Devlopment.
  Partaking in various Front-End Development courses after graduation provided me with an insight into the correlation between design and technology, hence why I decided to transition into this field.
  It also makes use of my academic background and interdisciplinary degree course where I had to connect different branches of knowledge.
